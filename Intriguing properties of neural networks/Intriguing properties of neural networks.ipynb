    "\n",
    "​This paper reports two counter-intuitive properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is the **space**, rather than the individual units, that contains the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks.\n",
    "- We can cause the network to **misclassify an image** by applying **a certain hardly perceptible perturbation**, which is found by maximizing the network’s prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.\n",
    "\n",
    "​We term the so perturbed examples “**adversarial examples**”. These results suggest that the deep neural networks that are learned by backpropagation have nonintuitive characteristics and intrinsic blind spots, **whose structure is connected to the data distribution in a non-obvious way**."
